# 42 Piscine C++

The C++ piscine at the 42 school is a series of small exercises aimed at
teaching the basics of C++ to students who already have a grasp of the C
language basics.

The project is divided into several modules, each addressing a specific concept
of C++ through multiple exercises.

The mandated C++ version is C++ 98 exclusively for all exercises.

## Modules

Here are the concepts covered in the different modules:

- Module 0: Understanding the specifics of C++ compared to C.
- Module 1: Memory allocation, references, pointers to members, and the use of
  switch.
- Module 2: Ad-hoc polymorphism, overloading, and orthodox canonical classes.
- Module 3: Inheritance.
- Module 4: Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces.
- Module 5: try/catch and exceptions.
- Module 6: Different types of casts.
- Module 7: Templates.
- Module 8: Template containers, iterators, and the algorithms library.
- Module 9: Practical implementation of containers.
